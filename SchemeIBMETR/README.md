## SchemeIBMETR

This is the category of the proposed IBMETR cryptography scheme, which outperforms the baselines, the AIBE, ARES, IBME, and IBMECH cryptography schemes.

### ``SchemeIBMETR.py``

This is the official implementation of the IBMETR cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library.

### ``SchemeAIBE.py``

This is a possible implementation of the AIBE cryptography scheme (``Anonymous hierarchical identity-based encryption (without random oracles)``) in Python programming language based on the Python charm library.
