## SchemeIBMETR

This is the implementation of the IBMETR scheme, with AIBE, ARES, IBMECH, etc. as the baselines. 

#### SchemeIBMETR.py

This is the implementation of the IBMETR scheme based on the Python programming language. 

#### SchemeAIBE.py

This is the implementation of the AIBE scheme (``Anonymous hierarchical identity-based encryption (without random oracles)``) based on the Python programming language.
