## SchemeAAIBME

This is the category of the proposed AA-IB-ME cryptography scheme, which outperforms the baselines, the Fuzzy-IB-ME and Fuzzy-ME cryptography schemes. 

This category is still under development. 

#### ``SchemeAAIBME.py``

This is the official implementation of the AA-IB-ME cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library. 

#### ``SchemeFuzzyIBME.py``

This is a possible implementation of the Fuzzy-IB-ME cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library. 

#### ``SchemeFuzzyME.py``

This is a possible implementation of the Fuzzy-ME cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library.
