## SchemeIBMEMR

This is the category of the proposed IBMEMR cryptography scheme, which outperforms the baselines, the IBME and the IBBME cryptography schemes. 

### ``SchemeIBMEMR.py``

This is the official implementation of the IBMEMR cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library. 

### ``SchemeIBME.py``

This is the implementation of the IBME cryptography scheme (``Match me if you can: Matchmaking encryption and its applications``) in Python programming language based on the Python charm library, referring to the official implementation from [https://github.com/xuehuan-yang/PSME/blob/main/src/04_ibme/04_ibme.py](https://github.com/xuehuan-yang/PSME/blob/main/src/04_ibme/04_ibme.py).
