## SchemeIBPME

This is the category of the proposed IBPRME cryptography scheme, which outperforms the baselines, the IBPME, the IBMECH, and the PBAC cryptography schemes. 

### ``SchemeIBPRME.py``

This is the official implementation of the IBPRME cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library. 

### ``SchemeIBME.py`` (soft link)

This is the implementation of the IBME cryptography scheme (``Match me if you can: Matchmaking encryption and its applications``) in Python programming language based on the Python charm library, referring to the official implementation from [https://github.com/xuehuan-yang/PSME/blob/main/src/04_ibme/04_ibme.py](https://github.com/xuehuan-yang/PSME/blob/main/src/04_ibme/04_ibme.py).
