## SchemeIBPME

This is the category of the proposed IBPRME cryptography scheme, which outperforms the baselines, the IBPME and the PBAC cryptography schemes. 

This category is still under development. 

### ``SchemeIBPRME.py``

This is the official implementation of the IBPRME cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library. 

### ``SchemeIBPME.py``

This is a possible implementation of the IBPME cryptography scheme (``Identity-based proxy matchmaking encryption for cloud-based anonymous messaging systems``) in Python programming language based on the Python charm library.
