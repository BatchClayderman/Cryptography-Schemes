## SchemeCANIFPPCT

This is the category of the proposed CA-NI-FPPCT cryptography scheme, which outperforms the baseline, the CA-NI-PSI cryptography scheme. 

This category is still under development. 

#### ``SchemeCANIFPPCT.py``

This is the official implementation of the CA-NI-FPPCT cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library. 

#### ``SchemeCANIPSI.py``

This is a possible implementation of the CA-NI-PSI cryptography scheme in Python programming language based on the Python charm library.
